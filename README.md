Hello!

It's simple weather app built with react that uses [openweathermap.org](openweathermap.org) api.

If you want to use it, please get your own api key as the one used here will be blocked after reaching 60 reqs per minute.

Also, it's still work-in-progress, so follow me if you liked it :D I'm just doing it for fun and to get known with react.
